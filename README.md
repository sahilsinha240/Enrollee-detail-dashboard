# Enrollee-detail-dashboard
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>With the Powerbi dashboard, I was able to successfully complete the assignment from PaperPedia. The dataset I worked with contained enrollee registration information, which I was able to organize and visualize in an easy to understand manner. This process of sorting and displaying the data made it simpler for viewers to get a better understanding of the results.</h3>

<h3>In the Powerbi task, the first page of the dashboard displayed the enrollee details. We used pie chart enrollee id to show enrollee education level and experience. After that in column chart I check the gender of all enrollee. Now after that in the same page of dashboard I have checked the sum of target by city and by training hour in line chart and area chart.</h3>

<h3>Apart from this in my second page of the dashboard displayed the enrollee detail using slicer to point out the enrollee id. Now in the gauge I have checked the sum of target according to the city development and then I have checked treemap of training hour with respect to major discipline and then I checked last new job of enrollee id in relevant experience using stacked area chart and compare these in another chart with major discipline. At end of second page of dashboard I have compare the city development, education level and company size according to experience.</h3>
